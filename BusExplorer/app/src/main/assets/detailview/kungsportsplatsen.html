    Kungsportsplatsen is a square in the city centre of Gothenburg, Sweden. The square was constructed 1852 and got its name after theKing's Port (the name literally means The King's Port Place). The gate was the main entrance to the fortified city, which was and still is surrounded by a moat. When the city grew outside the moat and there was no need to defend the city any longer the gate was torn down. At Kungsportsplatsen there is a statue of king Charles IX, which was placed there 1904.

    Statyn kallas Kopparmärra, vilket är göteborgarnas eget namn på statyn.
